## Overview
This repository explores historical trends in exercise and air travel using statistical analyses of the Blackmore and AirPassengers datasets in R.

## Contents
1. **Blackmore Dataset Analysis**
   - Repeated measures ANOVA comparing exercise levels at ages 8, 10, and 12.
   - Significant findings on the impact of age on exercise levels.

2. **AirPassengers Dataset Analysis**
   - Differencing to analyze growth trends.
   - Change point analysis for shifts in variability and mean of air travel.
   - Linking statistical findings to historical developments in commercial aviation during the 1950s.

## Findings
- Age significantly affects exercise levels in children.
- Notable shifts in air travel post-1950s, reflecting technological advancements and societal changes.
- Statistical techniques provide deep insights into historical trends and patterns.

## Conclusions
This study demonstrates the power of statistical analysis in uncovering historical trends. By examining exercise patterns and the evolution of air travel, it sheds light on broader societal and technological changes.
